Group Assignment 1
------------------
Group 1:
	Aditya V Kamath
	Pushkar Singh
	Avin E M
	Chowdari Sai Teja
	Deva Akhil

System Requirements
-------------------
The shell is completely POSIX compliant and should work on any POSIX OS.
We have additionally used the GNU Readline library to get input from the console
as well as keep track of history. This library is wiely available for all POSIX
compliant OSes, and is usually installed by default(even Minx has it).

To install readline library in Linux:
	sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

To install readline library in Minix:
	pkgin in readline-6.2

To compile the shell:
	
	tar xvf group1.tar
	cd group1
	make

For compilation on Minix use:
	make -f Makefile.minix

To run the shell:
	./group1

There should be no compile errors and the executable "group1" should be
generated in the same folder.

Usage
-----
Our shell works like any other shell,and you can type any command which exists
in the PATH variable and it will execute and display the output. Piping and file
redirections and background processes are also supported.
Pressing the up and down arrow keys you can go through the previously typed 
commands and then execute them.

Cons with Minix
---------------
The shell supports background processes. Since Minix does not have job control,
setpgid function isnt available. Hence background processes may get killed upon
sending signals to the foreground process.
